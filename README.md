# Exploring-the-Power-Pose
Amy Cuddy had a Ted Talk that went viral about the benefits of a power pose. However, were her findings valid? Here I examine Amy Cuddy's power pose data from a statistical perspective.

ccy-clean-data.tab - original data used in the analysis
Cuddy_analysis.R - code attempting to reproduce the analysis and findings
Power_Pose_Poster.pptx - Poster summarizing my findings


In the end, I found a lot of model variability as I changed covariates included in the model. 
I do not believe the model was stable enough to draw valid conclusions.
